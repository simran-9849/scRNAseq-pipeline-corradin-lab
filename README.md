# scRNA-seq Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis pipeline implemented using Snakemake and Seurat. The pipeline provides a streamlined workflow for processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data, from raw sequencing files to downstream analyses.

## Key Features

- Modular design using Snakemake for reproducible and scalable analyses
- Integration of Seurat for robust single-cell analysis
- Quality control and preprocessing of raw sequencing data
- Cell clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Differential expression analysis
- Marker gene identification
- Trajectory inference
- Cell type annotation
- Visualization of results

## Pipeline Steps

1. Raw data processing (Cell Ranger for 10x Genomics data)
2. Quality control and filtering
3. Normalization and feature selection
4. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE)
5. Clustering analysis
6. Differential expression analysis
7. Marker gene identification
8. Trajectory inference
9. Cell type annotation
10. Generation of analysis reports and visualizations

## Usage

The pipeline can be easily configured and run on local machines or high-performance computing clusters. Detailed instructions for installation, configuration, and execution are provided in the documentation.

## Requirements

- Snakemake
- R with Seurat package
- Python 3
- Other dependencies specified in the environment.yaml file

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and output descriptions, can be found in the `docs/` directory.
